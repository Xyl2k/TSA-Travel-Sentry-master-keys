3D TSA "Travel Sentry" master keys
=========
Recently, pictures of TSA master baggage keys got leaked by the Washington Post, this is a [reproduction](https://twitter.com/InfoSecJesus/status/641662669758574593) attempt.

Security researchers have long warned of the dangers of using [master-keyed locks](http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html)

> **[!] Important**: This set of keys haven't been tested, at least i tried to be accurate from the pictures of ```@darksim905``` those 3D models are here for key collectors only, not intended to be put on a lock.

> Alright seem to work on real [TSA locks](https://twitter.com/bernard/status/641662069427847168) don't abuse of that and have fun :)

> Added the stubby versions of the keys by [MS3FGX](https://github.com/MS3FGX), thanks ! [still work fine !](https://twitter.com/JimyLongs/status/641820527892414464)

> Moved original (too small) keys to Original_Small directory. Created new directories for "Full-Size" keys by J0hnnyXm4s. Only 007 has been tested. 006 Has been temporarily removed from new sets as only one side of it is completed. Need photo of both sides of the real key!
