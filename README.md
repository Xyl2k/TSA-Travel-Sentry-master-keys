3D TSA "Travel Sentry" master keys
=========
Recently, pictures of TSA master baggage keys got leaked by the Washington Post and also [PDFs](https://www.travelsentry.org/security/pdf/passkeys.pdf) hosted on TravelSentry's Website. This repo is a [reproduction attempt](https://twitter.com/InfoSecJesus/status/641662669758574593) 

Security researchers have [long warned](http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html) of the dangers of using [master-keyed locks](https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s/status/642123709311008768)

The TSA has issued an official statement making it known that [they don't even care that we've done this](https://theintercept.com/2015/09/16/tsa-doesnt-really-care-luggage-locks-hacked/), as the now-pointless locks affect theft prevention, not airline safety. 

> **[!] Important**: These keys have not been widely-tested, though we do have reports that many [do work](https://twitter.com/bernard/status/641662069427847168) from at least [one source](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/video-3d-printed-tsa-travel-sentry-keys-really-do-open-tsa-locks/). 006 May never work, as we're not sure of the depth of the "dimples," and also consumer-grade 3D printers may not be up to such finely-detailed tasks.

> Added the stubby versions of the keys by [MS3FGX](https://github.com/MS3FGX), which appear to [still work fine !](https://twitter.com/JimyLongs/status/641820527892414464)

### Thanks:
- Special thanks to [@darksim905](https://twitter.com/darksim905) and [@irongeek_adc](https://twitter.com/irongeek_adc/status/640907196197404672) and some anonymous others who all sent us images and information surrounding these keys. Also, [@j0hnnyXm4s](https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s) for his key size ratios and issue management / advice.



PROBLEM REPORTING
=========

If you print a key and it doesn't work:
	
* First, use a caliper or other highly-accurate device to make sure the key you printed is accurate to the model. Humidity, expansion & ambient room temperature can have serious effects on print size accuracy.

* If it IS accurate, open an issue on the github, specify the problem file, and what problems exist (i.e. "Too wide for the keyway," "Too tall for the keyway," etc.).

* Upload a picture of your lock's keyway. 

* If you have the original keys for the lock, provide a measurement of the key from shoulder to tip, total height of the shoulders, and width. (i.e. X, Y & Z axes of the blade). Some keys only have one shoulder.
