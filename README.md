3D TSA "Travel Sentry" master keys
=========
Recently, pictures of TSA master baggage keys got leaked by the Washington Post, this is a [reproduction](https://twitter.com/InfoSecJesus/status/641662669758574593) attempt.

Security researchers have long warned of the dangers of using [master-keyed locks](http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html)

> **[!] Important**: This set of keys haven't been tested, at least i tried to be accurate from the pictures of ```@darksim905``` those 3D models are here for key collectors only, not intended to be put on a lock.

> Alright seem to work on real [TSA locks](https://twitter.com/bernard/status/641662069427847168) don't abuse of that and have fun :)
