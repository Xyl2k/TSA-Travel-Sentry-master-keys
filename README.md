3D TSA "Travel Sentry" master keys
=========
Recently, pictures of TSA master baggage keys got leaked by the Washington Post and also [PDFs](https://www.travelsentry.org/security/pdf/passkeys.pdf) hosted on TravelSentry's Website. This repo is a [reproduction attempt](https://twitter.com/InfoSecJesus/status/641662669758574593) 

Security researchers have [long warned](http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html) of the dangers of using [master-keyed locks](https://twitter.com/J0hnnyXm4s/status/642123709311008768)

> **[!] Important**: These keys have not been widely-tested, though we do have reports that all except 006 [do work](https://twitter.com/bernard/status/641662069427847168) from at least [one source](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/video-3d-printed-tsa-travel-sentry-keys-really-do-open-tsa-locks/) each. 006 May never work, as we're not sure of the depth of the "dimples," and also consumer-grade 3D printers may not be up to such finely-detailed tasks.

> Added the stubby versions of the keys by [MS3FGX](https://github.com/MS3FGX), which appear to [still work fine !](https://twitter.com/JimyLongs/status/641820527892414464)
